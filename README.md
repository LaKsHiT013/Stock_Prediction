# Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Prediction

This Python project utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to predict future stock prices based on historical data. It employs the yfinance library to fetch historical stock price data and then performs statistical analysis and simulation to predict future prices.

# Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

> yfinance
> numpy
> matplotlib
> scipy

# Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Open the Python script monte_carlo_stock_prediction.py in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
4. Update the start_date, end_date, and ticker variables with the desired stock symbol and date range.
5. Run the script.

The script will fetch historical stock price data, perform statistical analysis, and generate Monte Carlo simulations to predict future stock prices. The results will be displayed both graphically and in the console.
